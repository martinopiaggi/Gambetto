# Gambetto

## Overview and Vision Statement

Gambetto combines the strategic depth of chess with the frenetic pace of arcade games.
Set in abstract, rotating dungeons, players take on the role of a chess pawn facing various challenges. As they navigate, they can transform using the abilities of other chess pieces, introducing layers of strategy and gameplay depth.

Genre

Arcade-Strategy Hybrid

Platforms

PC, Mobile

Analysis of the Market
Games like "Monument Valley" showcase the appetite for visually striking, innovative puzzle games. "The Binding of Isaac" and "Crossy Road" prove that arcade elements, combined with depth, have a broad appeal.


## Gameplay

Gambetto thrusts players into a world where chess meets action. As a pawn, players must traverse intricate dungeons, avoiding enemies and leveraging the powers of other chess pieces.

### Core Mechanics

- Chess-inspired Movement: Navigate using the movement rules of chess pieces.
- Movement Rhythms: Sync your moves with the ticking of an in-game clock. Mistime your move, and face the consequences.
- Chess Transformations: Collect transparent chess pieces to temporarily gain their movement abilities.
- Enemy Elimination: Rare power-ups allow players to eliminate certain enemies.
- Quick Levels: Short, intense levels, especially during the initial phases.

Challenges
- Time Pressure: Players must make their move within a time limit or remain stationary.
- Dynamic Enemies: Some move in sync with the player, while others have their unique rhythms.


- Dual-Pawn Control: Maybe in specific levels, control two pawns simultaneously, adding a layer of complexity and strategy.
- Rotating Rooms: Dynamic rooms that periodically rotate, altering paths and challenges.


## Characters

- The Pawn (Player): The main character who embarks on this journey, harnessing the powers of other pieces.
- Enemy Pieces: Various chess pieces, each with unique movement patterns, challenge the player throughout the journey.

## Story

In a surreal chess world, a lone pawn seeks to become a king. To do so, it must navigate a maze of challenges and adversaries, learning from other pieces and growing in strength.

## World

The setting is an abstract, ever-changing chessboard. Each level is a unique dungeon, some of which rotate or shift, challenging the player's spatial awareness.

## Media List

- Art Style: Minimalist, with a touch of surrealism, inspired by "Monument Valley".
- Music: Ambient, with rhythmic elements echoing the ticking of the in-game clock.
- Sound Effects: Discrete, emphasizing movements, captures, and transformations.


Gambetto Project Structure Overview

1. Materials
- Two distinct chessboard materials: Dark and Light. These could represent the two different colored squares on a chessboard.
- background fog 
- gradient background 
- maybe the player can choose to be white/black piece. And if black it's hard because we can make that for the first turn only the enemies (white) moves (like in chess white move first)


Scenes

- Multiple scenes including:
- A main menu for game navigation.
- Several testing or development scenes, like "Prova" and "SampleScene", indicating ongoing development and experimentation.

Scripts
- Main Game Logic:
- Scripts for audio management, cell interactions, grid management, level flow, main menu functionality, and UI management.

- Chess Piece Logic:
- A script for the basic behavior of chess pieces.

- Room Logic:
- Scripts related to room behavior and layout, indicating dynamic and varied level designs.
- Manually design rooms and concatenate rooms layouts/specifications easily in each level 

- Utilities:
- Several utility scripts for constants, debugging, and movement directions, among others. These are crucial for game functionality and development efficiency.

- Sounds
- Audio files for theme music and sound effects, which will contribute to the game's ambiance and player feedback.
