Gambetto is an open-source casual arcade game enriched with puzzle elements, crafted with passion by a team of five MSc Engineering students as part of a university project at Politecnico di Milano. 
Player navigates through dungeon-like levels, facing enemy chess pieces and using power-ups to gain new abilities. 
Currently offering 20 minutes of gameplay, Gambetto serves as a proof of concept. You can play Gambetto downloading executables from [itch.io page](https://polimi-game-collective.itch.io/gambetto) 

We are dedicated to expanding and refining Gambetto.
A tiny architecture overview of the game can be found in the [game design document](game%20design%20document.md).
